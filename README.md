# NeverEmptyListView

This custom listview basically shows a holder view when it's adapter is empty. For example, you may fetch list datas from network and refresh your adapter with coming data. If the data is empty, your listview shows a huge blank space. With this custom listview, you can show a holder view instead of blank space and your design looks prettier.
